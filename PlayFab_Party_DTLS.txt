When PlayFab request to make a party.
It sends back an ip to an aws list of servers.
This server has a unique way of communication.
As in the return json it has interesting data: "DTLS"
DTLS means Datagram Transport Layer Security.
That means its encrypted communication.
Happily IEEE has a standart for it.
DTLS is similar to TLS over TCP.
Not many people implemented this kind of communication.
Good news to us because PlayFab's dll's has PDB!
